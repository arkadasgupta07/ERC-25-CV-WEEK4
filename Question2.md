# Computer Vision Based Drawing Tool Pad  

Welcome to the Computer Vision Drawing Tool Pad!  
In this project, you will build an interactive application that lets users draw on their screen using just their **index finger** and a webcam. The program leverages **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** for real-time hand tracking to detect finger positions and render drawings directly on the video feed.

## Problem Statement  

Create a computer vision-based drawing pad where:  
- The userâ€™s **index finger** acts as a virtual pen.  
- Moving the finger across the webcam feed draws on the screen.  
- The drawing should update in **real-time** as the user moves their hand.  
- Users should be able to **switch pen colors, toggle an eraser, change line styles, and clear the canvas** through specific commands or gestures.

## Features  

- **Real-time Hand Tracking**: Detects and tracks hand landmarks using MediaPipe.  
- **Virtual Pen Drawing**: Draw lines on the webcam feed using the index finger.  
- **Interactive Drawing Controls**: Implement commands that allow users to:
  - Switch between different **colors** (e.g., red, blue, green).  
  - Toggle an **eraser mode** to remove drawings.  
  - Change **line style** (thickness or dashed/solid lines).  
  - **Clear the canvas** with a command or gesture.  
- **Intuitive and Fun**: Just a webcam is enough to get started.
